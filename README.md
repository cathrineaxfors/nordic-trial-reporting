Data processing and analysis: Research project on trial reporting in the Nordic countries (protocol: https://osf.io/wua3r)

DESCRIPTION UNDER CONSTRUCTION

In this repository, we share the code and data used for the project "Systematic evaluation of clinical trial reporting at medical universities and university hospitals in the Nordic countries" by Cathrine Axfors, Gustav Nilsonne, and team. Preregistered protocol: https://osf.io/97qkv/

OBS! Raw data that complement the current repository can be found on Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/10091147

Script 1a creates the sample of trials from ClinicalTrials.gov. It creates an R data file to be combined with EUCTR trials using script 1b, containing relevant trials from AACT (institution, years, status, completion date, descriptive data). Note that the final assignment of trials to institutions was verified manually. It also creates a dataset of CTgov variables to be used in script 2.

Script 1b Creates the sample of trials from EUCTR and combines with ClinicalTrials.gov sample generated by script 1. Also performs automatic cross-registration identification based on registry information (additional trial IDs mentioned in registrations). Trials are selected based on institution, completion year, and status. Also adds EUCTR variables to the dataset for later descriptive purposes.

Script 2 performs data cleaning of variables from ClinicalTrials.gov and EUCTR to prepare the analysis dataset.
OBS! Between the automatic output from scripts 1a-1b and this one, we manually assessed trials for eligibility; performed extensive manual searches for publications; manually searched and verified cross-registrations; and verified summary results posted in the EUCTR.

Script 3 performs the data analysis to produce in-text results (in console only), tables, and figures. We also share manually curated tables and figures.

PUBLICATIONS DATABASE to be used for further curation and research can be found in the folder 4-created-database together with a variable description.
